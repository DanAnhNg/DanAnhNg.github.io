# **Leadership Approaches**

## **Situational Approaches**

There are different situational leadership approaches:
- Directing
- Coaching
- Delegating
- Supporting

### **Directing style**

- High directive + low supportive
- Primarily for new employees
- Focus on communicating goal achievement
- Emphasise instructions and close supervisions
- Celebrate positive results and offer remedies for less positive results

### **Coaching**

High directive + high supportive
- Focus more on relationship development and building trust
- Encourage feedback exchanges and followers’ inputs
- More “suggesting” and less “telling” – the goal is to provide recognition to followers and help them to progress further
- The leader still needs to decide “what” are the goals and “how” to achieve them

### **Supporting**

- Low directive + high supportive
- For employees who are competent but still inconsistent and not fully committed
- Provide check-ins, not monitoring and detailed instructions (this can be done e.g., in the form of weekly 1:1’s)
- The focus shift to follower-driven and relationship-focused, which surrounds active listening, exchanging feedback

### **Delegating**

- Low directive + low supportive
- The ultimate goal that involves fully empowered and competent employees to take control over their tasks and achieving outcomes
- There is low focus on both tasks and relationships; continued praise for outstanding performance can be appropriately given
- The leader now serves as an advisor or consultant to the follower
